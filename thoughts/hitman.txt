so ive always had this dumb idea about a hitman game where you book expensive hotels and --
you have a cool golden eye watch and you take jobs which is about killing npcs. it would --
be cool because the npcs have basic schedules and even places they live in. stalking --
the npc and silently killing them and disposing of them would be the goal of teh game. however --
the problem is the violence itself. and the childish idea of hitmen is pretty dumb.

i can kind of see this working but the game would need a real good reason for you to behave
like this. like in hotline miami. you would be killing henchmen who are already armed and --
or guilty of violence themselves. this is how almost all mainstream games work. you dont --
kill innocents, you kill the bad guys who take it and they kinda knew the risks, so --
they are probably cool with it.

i could make a cool themed game with violence but maybe this is the wrong time, to release more --
killing oriented games. maybe i absolutely shouldn't. mom wouldn't be happy. maybe no one would be.

on the other hand i'd be happy to add a gun and make a fun fps with killing as its goal. but --
i can perhaps go non lethal or some such. water pistol? thats actually way too silly. why is it --
such a gamy thing to shoot and maim people? again right now just isn't the time.
