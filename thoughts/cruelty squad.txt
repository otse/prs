cruelty squad has a nice trailer on steam
where they put cool texts over the gameplay,
while clearly being a part of the trailer

texts:
dominate humiliate enjoy relax
do you find pleasure in failure?
pragmatic economics
glory and terror
will i ever regain my soul?
you must have a thing for high frequency depression
the gravity of life is unbearable
it will crush you
there's a limit to everything
even you can find peace
i'm so afraid...
i have wasted my youth.
there's no special someone for me :(
my body is rotting...
is there hope for me?
i have an overabundance of Life
power brings me joy...
dReamz... of a better place?
the future isn't set...
but your life is
little ape of suffering
dopamine terrorist
does this even make you feel something?
