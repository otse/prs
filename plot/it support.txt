if there is a plot it should fit the silly graphics.

there's a post it note of a zoning out cat.
there's an amazon alexa and a cardboard box with compact discs.
life is minimal here.

whatever could be the point of such a 3d game?

you go to work. you work at the it department of a big business.

you have to repair computers, and answer questions from employees and executives.

the goal of the game is to not say rude things to the wrong people, and not to
fail the simple tasks you are given.

when you are rude, or answer incorrectly, you will get a negative mark. on the other hand,
when you are helpful and or polite, you get a positive mark. sometimes an answer will be right,
but also rude, and you will still get a negative mark.

try not to fall to -5, or you will go to HR, and will be given one last chance.

example: an older employee with an important function asks you for a usb stick:
answers:
- ill get you one right away
- have you tried network file sharing

example: an executive wants an important file back on his computer
answers:
- have you looked in the recycle bin?
- i will try to find it in the backup

preliminary status: the suck. answers are too obviously negative or positive.
