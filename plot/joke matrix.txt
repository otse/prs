INSPIRATION: Cruelty Squad, PSX, Matrix

you are in your apt. theres a tv playing something. your smartphone on the table goes off.
its your ----. you have to come in to work this afternoon.

you take the elevator to your "car". you drive to work with some funny music.

the elevator has a "broken" note on it. you have to take the stairwell. this isn't funny design.

you arrive at the 30th floor and there's a poster of an airliner.

the view is very high. there's planters. your bosses name alludes to mr. fujiwara somehow.

the boss tells you there cutting costs and asks you to grab eco paper from cold storage to refill
the printer. a black employee with glasses talks to you on your way back.
he redpills you about the new recycled look of the paper.

on your way back the broom closet is open. add a stanley parable joke? there could be an optional
discovery in this area that helps explain the plot.

you walk past cubicles on your way to the printer. you insert the paper into the tray.

the boss is waiting for you. he has a personal issue. he wants you to take the office plants
from the corrupt it department.

you return to boss. he wants another favor.
