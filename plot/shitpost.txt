this started as a kill the baby from ice age -inspired game

idea. you start in apartment. you put some pts into your character.
skills:
good looking - zuck - religion - car person - mone

you can choose 2 skills
for example, you can have zuck, and religionwa

alexa wakes you up. she says:
hey. its me alexa. your virtual assistant.
...
you had too many red bulls last night. and pizza. your world is spinning, is it not?
anyway.
you did not pay rent yesterday. the landlord will be here any moment.
whatever you do, remember: don't talk about his outfit.

hasbullah appears and asks: i am here for rent. do you have the mone
[zuck initiative] i would probably choose not to do that publicly here
   -> hasb: ok but i will need the mone eventually
[mone] yes, here
   -> hasb: thanks. airbnb was such a good idea
[missing skill] i dont have the mone
   -> hasb: i accept an object of >= value
[informal] what are you wearing?

when you ask about his outfit, you die.

when you miss the skills, alexa will help out.
alexa: we can handle this. just give him the fridge.

-> when you try to give hasbullah the toilet: no. something else
(this means alexa isn't always right)

not much can go wrong in the intro of the game. you give hasbullah mone,
use your zuck instincts or simply give him your fridge as payment.

alexa:
you did it. you restored the order. but today will still be
full of difficulties. let me help. i know the way through the fog.
also, you have to be at work by 10.

you go downstairs. the janitor is mopping. when he turns to look at you,
its hasbullah in a different style. as you try to pass, he initiates a talk.

the floors are wet. you're welcome.
