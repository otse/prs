this started as a kill the baby from ice age -inspired game

idea. you start in apartment. you put some pts into your character.
skills:
good looking - religion - car person - cat person - money

you go downstairs but the front door is locked. the janitor is mopping. he wants money
for the key.
when you got enough points in money, you can bribe him for the key.
you can also do a religion check on him if you got the points invested. this will question his
alignment to civilization and whether looting people is the right course of action.

when you have neither points enough you will have to crawl through a vent.

when you get out the door there's your car. a cat is sitting on the car. if you are a cat
person, you can coax it. also if you are religious enough you can drive with the car on the
hood (it is unorthodox).

you park at the local cofee house that you frequent. the clerk works there
