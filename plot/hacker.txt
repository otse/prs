you live in a small, messy place. it looks like
a hackers haven actually. you have servers, cameras and monitors. you maybe even
have a paper shredder. there are floppy and compact discs. light is streaming in
from your blinds. there is an orange evening blade runner hue in the room.

you open the window for air. close the blinds for privacy. cook some instant noodles
and send a finished hack via floppy via mail.

the hallway could be added and a backstreet with a corner store and pharmacy, so
you can get some prescription and dick around. this just turned into a hacking game
with doomer elements.
